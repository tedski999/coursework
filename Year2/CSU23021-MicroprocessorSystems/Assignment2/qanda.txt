1. What does the term "Memory Mapped" in "Memory Mapped I/O" mean?
When I/O devices are mapped to an address/location in the memory space.

2. What is the difference between a byte-sized memory-mapped interface register and a regular byte of RAM?
A byte of memory in a memory-mapped interface register represents 8 I/O pins connected in hardware.
A regular byte of RAM is simply 8 bits of volatile system memory.

3. Why is polling considered to be inefficient?
The CPU must poll frequently to not miss anything. In interrupt driven I/O, the CPU does not need to waste
computational power if nothing has happened.

4. How could you organise polling of two or more interfaces?
You could poll each interface sequentially. The order of polling interfaces A and B could be A, B, A, B, A, B...

5. Why would polling be bad for a computer's energy consumption?
The CPU must poll frequently to not miss anything. This is wasted computational power, causing higher enery consumption.
