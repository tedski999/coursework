\section*{On The Threat of Supply Chain Attacks}

In only the last couple of weeks, there has been a number of major security and privacy incident revelations. Of particular note have been the OS command injection vulnerability found in GlobalProtect firewall devices, the GoFetch side-channel attack against Apple M1 CPUs, and the interception and decryption of SSL traffic orchestrated by Facebook against users of competitor services though Project Ghostbusters~\cite{CVE-2024-3400, gofetch, 369872}. We have also seen a use-after-free bug in Linux kernel exploited to perform privilege escalation with CVE-2024-1086 as well as a key recovery leak on the PuTTY SSH and Telnet client~\cite{CVE-2024-1086, CVE-2024-31497}.
